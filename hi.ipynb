       "0  installing the game was a struggle (because of games for windows live bugs).some championship races and cars can only be \"unlocked\" by buying them as an addon to the game. i paid nearly 30 dollars when the game was new. i don't like the idea that i have to keep paying to keep playing.i noticed no improvement in the physics or graphics compared to dirt 2.i tossed it in the garbage and vowed never to buy another codemasters game. i'm really tired of arcade style rally/racing games anyway.i'll continue to get my fix from richard burns rally, and you should to. :)http://www.amazon.com/richard-burns-rally-pc/dp/b000c97156/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&qid;=1341886844&sr;=8-1&keywords;=richard+burns+rallythank you for reading my review! if you enjoyed it, be sure to rate it as helpful.   \n",

       "33449  the resident evil series is renowned for reinventing itself through innovations, but dead aim has one of the riskiest new ideas yet: reliance on the guncon 2 peripheral for shooting sequences. unlike the first-person disaster resident evil survivor, dead aim's diverse play mechanics add spice to an otherwise routine episode of monster blasting and puzzle solving. dead aim is basically an upgraded version of resident evil gaiden for the game boy color. you explore a monster-infested ship and other locales, collect items and weapons, and fight for your life. dead aim, however, throws in a unique twist: access a weapon, and you automatically go from third- to first-person view for arcade shooting along the lines of house of the dead. surprisingly enough, the combination works but not without a few deficiencies. the system allows for rampant cheating, and unless the gun peripheral is perfectly calibrated, you're going to waste a lot of ammo, which is already in short supply. dead aim's also relatively short with few rewards for repeat players, and although it carries the resident evil prefix, its narrative isn't nearly as involving as that of other games in the series. dead aim uses a full 3d visual scheme instead of the trademark pre-rendered environments. the result is fewer offscreen surprises and a very clean look, albeit at the cost of environmental details (like candles and other objects). there's also a welcome emphasis on stealth tactics as you're forced to move slowly and silently through various areas, and make as little noise as possible during particular boss battles. accessible controls keep the action in line, and even sans the gun peripheral, the analog-stick substitute is a surprisingly playable alternative to the guncon 2. yet despite the new look and other features, dead aim's still filled with traditional evil clich&eacute;s. if you're a huge resident evil fan or a newcomer to the series, dead aim's worth the time investment. although it's a middling side quest at best in the context of the resident evil universe, it's an engaging action/shooter.   \n",

       "33449  the resident evil series is renowned for reinventing itself through innovations  but dead aim has one of the riskiest new ideas yet  reliance on the guncon 2 peripheral for shooting sequences  unlike the first person disaster resident evil survivor  dead aim s diverse play mechanics add spice to an otherwise routine episode of monster blasting and puzzle solving  dead aim is basically an upgraded version of resident evil gaiden for the game boy color  you explore a monster infested ship and other locales  collect items and weapons  and fight for your life  dead aim  however  throws in a unique twist  access a weapon  and you automatically go from third  to first person view for arcade shooting along the lines of house of the dead  surprisingly enough  the combination works but not without a few deficiencies  the system allows for rampant cheating  and unless the gun peripheral is perfectly calibrated  you re going to waste a lot of ammo  which is already in short supply  dead aim s also relatively short with few rewards for repeat players  and although it carries the resident evil prefix  its narrative isn t nearly as involving as that of other games in the series  dead aim uses a full 3d visual scheme instead of the trademark pre rendered environments  the result is fewer offscreen surprises and a very clean look  albeit at the cost of environmental details  like candles and other objects   there s also a welcome emphasis on stealth tactics as you re forced to move slowly and silently through various areas  and make as little noise as possible during particular boss battles  accessible controls keep the action in line  and even sans the gun peripheral  the analog stick substitute is a surprisingly playable alternative to the guncon 2  yet despite the new look and other features  dead aim s still filled with traditional evil clich eacute s  if you re a huge resident evil fan or a newcomer to the series  dead aim s worth the time investment  although it s a middling side quest at best in the context of the resident evil universe  it s an engaging action shooter    \n",

       "      <td>first and for most...best game ever for xbox live play. this game was so good on so many levels. the single player campaign was fun...not insanely great, but fun....\"ghost recon fun.\" this is one of those games that is truly addicting and, in its day, got plenty of xbox live play. this game was actually the reason i signed up for an xbox live account, and without it, who knows what i'd be playing today.okay, so, in its time, this game had pretty good graphics. you look back at them now and they don't look too hot, but when it first came out it was awesome. other than that, i think the best thing about this game was its multiplayer aspects. not only were the maps great, but all the different modes of play were great. i remember when this game was popular, so many people played it, and it was obvious why. another great thing about this game is the fact that it is a very tactical shooter and not so run and gun like most fps games out on the market today. overall, this game is great and even today it stands up as a great shooter. if more people played on live (well, any at all) i think i might find myself playing this game quite a bit!9.0 presentationthis game was presented very well. the menus were very easy to use and were pretty clean cut and simple - great! doing things like joining games and checking friends list was never a hassle.8.0 graphicsback when this game came out, the graphics of this game were very good. i think if i were judging the graphics in todays world, i would score them pretty low, because, obviously, they don't stand up.7.0 soundthe sound effects and music in the game were good. they seemed to fit the game and mood and were good in its time. overall...pretty good!9.0 gameplaythis game played so well and the fact that it stayed \"tactical\" makes it even better. i loved the gameplay over xbox live and its multiplayer aspects were fantastic.10 lasting appealin its day, this game was played so much that it definately had lasting appeal. i \"over\"played this game until the day gr2 came out (which wasn't that great) and finally halo 2 took over my life!!!</td>\n",

       "      <td>nintendo had a of success with its 8-bit system, the nintendo, but sega decided to release the 16-bit genesis system that blew away any other system. so nintendo decided to make the super nintendo to compete with it. it was a great success.up until the release of the ps1 in 1996, the super nintendo was the top system on the market. with the biggest variety of games the snes was well ahead of its competition.the snes has great sound, graphics and great games. nintendo also made a great controller for the super nintendo. just like the nes it has a d-pad to move around with, a, b, x, and y  buttons to use for certain controls in different games, and a start and select button used to start pause the game, but they added the l and r buttons on the top of the controller and made the controller more rounded and much more comfortable.the games for the super nintendo are great. super mario world and donkey kong country top the lists as nintendo's best games ever made, but there are other great games too. there are great rpg games (including final fantasy iii and the legend of zelda), great adventure games (super mario world, yoshi's island, super mario all-stars, the donkey kong series, and earthbound), great racing titles (super mario kart and f-zero) and great fighting games (mortal kombat and street fighter).if you own a snes or are interested in getting one, you should get some of the games i listed above, which are some of the best snes games of all time, but there are hundreds of other games available.the snes has provided years of fun and entertainment for me and has never let me down. i recommend that you check out one of the best systems of all time. go out and buy a super nintendo and some great games while they are still available!</td>\n",

       "      <td>final fantasy ix, is, without a shadow of a doubt, my favorite video game of all-time. i first played it when it came out back in november of 2000.most of the ff's are great. everyone has a favorite - some people prefer vii, while others enjoy vi, and the old-school gamers like the early ones like i-iv. being that i'm an old-school gamer, i enjoyed ff ix simply because of all the references it makes to ff's from the past. it's like a big ff compendium, but this definitely isn't the only reason that ff ix is so good...the biggest reason i like ff ix is because of the story and characters. it will captivate you unlike any rpg before it. you can relate to at least one of the characters and the situations they face. i won't spoil the story, but it gets so amazing, and great character development adds to that.music is also great. it harkens back to the good ol' days of the ff series, with an amazing battle theme, boss theme, and even a remix of the old gurgu volcano music from ff i. it's all there, and in all, there are over 120 tracks if you count the fmv music.speaking of fmv's and graphics, they are also amazing. ff ix goes back to the deformed character designs of past ff's, but it all looks good. there are once again black and white mages, a medieval world with castles and dragons, airships, and my favorite ff mascot, moogles (they act as save points throughout the game).but, as no game is perfect, ff ix also has 2 tiny problems: 1) the challenge is on the easy side and 2) a lot of the key items are useless, even if they do raise your treasure hunter rank a little bit. but even so, these problems can be easily overlooked, because the game is so amazing.i recommend ff ix to the old-school ff fans, but even the ff fans who started with vii can enjoy this awesome ff. it's a great mixture of old-school and new-school ff's, which makes for an unforgettable adventure.</td>\n",

       "      <td>is the wii a good game system for gamers and for non-gamers?  in one word, yes!it is true that the wii does not have the graphics capabilities of some of its competitors, but `great graphics' do not make a great game. great graphics can only make a good game better. they certainly can't turn a poor game into a great game, just because it `looks' better.  well, the wii does not need great graphics, because it is already a great gaming system.i am primarily interested in games for the fun that they create. after all, if they aren't fun, then why would anyone want to play them?i am lucky enough to own a wii. i will tell you that it ain't so cheap. by the time you buy the basic system for $250 (that is list price.  good luck getting one.), then add 3 more controllers (wimotes plus nunchucks) at about $70 a set (you will want to buy 3 extra controller sets, as soon as you can), then add 10 games at $50 each, you will be out around $1000. that is a lot to spend if you just want some `good games' and you aren't a hard core gamer. but the wii is worth it.  the games are great fun. though the graphics of wii might someday be upgraded, the game play probably can't be improved.  the wii game play has already set the standard for all future gaming systems.  it is revolutionary,  intuitive and interactive, all at the same time. as a group game, social game and party game, it won't be topped for years to come. so, my verdict is that this is the game for people who want to have a good time. it is surprisingly easy, intuitive and engrossing, all at once. describing it is like desribing a roller coaster ride. you have to experience it to really understand it.  though it will please gamers and non-gamers alike, if you like to party, make sure to get the wii.</td>\n",

       "32792  first and for most...best game ever for xbox live play. this game was so good on so many levels. the single player campaign was fun...not insanely great, but fun....\"ghost recon fun.\" this is one of those games that is truly addicting and, in its day, got plenty of xbox live play. this game was actually the reason i signed up for an xbox live account, and without it, who knows what i'd be playing today.okay, so, in its time, this game had pretty good graphics. you look back at them now and they don't look too hot, but when it first came out it was awesome. other than that, i think the best thing about this game was its multiplayer aspects. not only were the maps great, but all the different modes of play were great. i remember when this game was popular, so many people played it, and it was obvious why. another great thing about this game is the fact that it is a very tactical shooter and not so run and gun like most fps games out on the market today. overall, this game is great and even today it stands up as a great shooter. if more people played on live (well, any at all) i think i might find myself playing this game quite a bit!9.0 presentationthis game was presented very well. the menus were very easy to use and were pretty clean cut and simple - great! doing things like joining games and checking friends list was never a hassle.8.0 graphicsback when this game came out, the graphics of this game were very good. i think if i were judging the graphics in todays world, i would score them pretty low, because, obviously, they don't stand up.7.0 soundthe sound effects and music in the game were good. they seemed to fit the game and mood and were good in its time. overall...pretty good!9.0 gameplaythis game played so well and the fact that it stayed \"tactical\" makes it even better. i loved the gameplay over xbox live and its multiplayer aspects were fantastic.10 lasting appealin its day, this game was played so much that it definately had lasting appeal. i \"over\"played this game until the day gr2 came out (which wasn't that great) and finally halo 2 took over my life!!!   \n",

       "32792  first and for most   best game ever for xbox live play  this game was so good on so many levels  the single player campaign was fun   not insanely great  but fun     ghost recon fun   this is one of those games that is truly addicting and  in its day  got plenty of xbox live play  this game was actually the reason i signed up for an xbox live account  and without it  who knows what i d be playing today okay  so  in its time  this game had pretty good graphics  you look back at them now and they don t look too hot  but when it first came out it was awesome  other than that  i think the best thing about this game was its multiplayer aspects  not only were the maps great  but all the different modes of play were great  i remember when this game was popular  so many people played it  and it was obvious why  another great thing about this game is the fact that it is a very tactical shooter and not so run and gun like most fps games out on the market today  overall  this game is great and even today it stands up as a great shooter  if more people played on live  well  any at all  i think i might find myself playing this game quite a bit 9 0 presentationthis game was presented very well  the menus were very easy to use and were pretty clean cut and simple   great  doing things like joining games and checking friends list was never a hassle 8 0 graphicsback when this game came out  the graphics of this game were very good  i think if i were judging the graphics in todays world  i would score them pretty low  because  obviously  they don t stand up 7 0 soundthe sound effects and music in the game were good  they seemed to fit the game and mood and were good in its time  overall   pretty good 9 0 gameplaythis game played so well and the fact that it stayed  tactical  makes it even better  i loved the gameplay over xbox live and its multiplayer aspects were fantastic 10 lasting appealin its day  this game was played so much that it definately had lasting appeal  i  over played this game until the day gr2 came out  which wasn t that great  and finally halo 2 took over my life      \n",

       "23336  this series keeps getting worse   the first game  for the ps1  was good   the second in the series  soul reaver  was fairly entertaining   the third  soul reaver ii  was so so  but far too short   blood omen ii is just plain bad   on the plus side  the urban feel of the level design is a nice change from the rest of the series where the developers focused more on ancient ruins  canyons  and forests   on the down side  game play is sluggish  at best   the controls are not responsive  making fight sequences tedious   the dialog during the cut scenes is totally off   i don t mean by a second or two  i m talking about voices coming from the wrong characters   sometimes the soundtrack is nonexistent   on top of that  ambient sounds have a tendency to get stuck in a loop  repeating themselves over and over  drowning out every other sound   the only remedy is to restart the game   i have also had some problems with the graphics   on occasion  when i enter a new area  the entire screen  aside from kain  goes blank   once again  the only effective remedy i have found is to restart the game   i ve used other discs on my console  so i know my system isn t on the blink   last  but not least  this game suffers from the curse of mandatory cut scenes   i m tired of having to sit through long  drawn out movies with no bypass option every time i replay a section of the game   i really wish i could give this game a better review  seeing that the developers must have put some sort of time and effort into making it  but i can t   \n",

       "      <td>looking for a challenging game that tests your mind and your reflexes? thief 3 rewards stealth and strategic thinking with glory and loot!if you somehow missed the first 2 episodes in the thief saga, you are ... a thief. you live in a medieval world full of murky inns, cobblestone streets and questionable denizens of the night. you get told of interesting items to steal by your fences, and do your best to acquire them.in many ways, this compares favorably to splinter cell, albeit of a different era. your task is to stay hidden in the shadows. you have to pay careful attention to the level of darkness where you stand, and the type of surfaces you walk over, to not draw attention to yourself. you have interesting tools at your disposal - noisemaking arrows to distract, water arrows to put out candles.the graphics aren't *quite* up to the level of splinter cell, but then again, not much is. you still get gorgeous shadows, dust motes twinkling in light streams, textures on floors and walls. the human figures are a bit clunky, but only a bit.that being said, the cinemtics are exceptional, both graphic and sound-wise. you really get drawn along with the story.the sounds are nicely done. this isn't a game of jamming rock music - it's a game of stealth. there are ambient noises that warn you of approaching guards, of a dog in the next room, of conversations of nearby people. the soft music, when it comes in, helps to add to the spookiness and tension.the ai really deserves special praise. the people around you don't just walk a beat that you watch 10 times in a row and then use. they react to situations with intelligence, keep an eye on things they should be guarding, and take proper caution when tracking down a problem. if they catch sight of you, they don't just go for you and give up. now that they know there's a strange person in the area, they actively hunt for you.sure, you can blackjack people if you have to. but the game isn't about violence. it's about avoiding being seen, avoiding being caught.highly recommended!</td>\n",

       "38528  looking for a challenging game that tests your mind and your reflexes? thief 3 rewards stealth and strategic thinking with glory and loot!if you somehow missed the first 2 episodes in the thief saga, you are ... a thief. you live in a medieval world full of murky inns, cobblestone streets and questionable denizens of the night. you get told of interesting items to steal by your fences, and do your best to acquire them.in many ways, this compares favorably to splinter cell, albeit of a different era. your task is to stay hidden in the shadows. you have to pay careful attention to the level of darkness where you stand, and the type of surfaces you walk over, to not draw attention to yourself. you have interesting tools at your disposal - noisemaking arrows to distract, water arrows to put out candles.the graphics aren't *quite* up to the level of splinter cell, but then again, not much is. you still get gorgeous shadows, dust motes twinkling in light streams, textures on floors and walls. the human figures are a bit clunky, but only a bit.that being said, the cinemtics are exceptional, both graphic and sound-wise. you really get drawn along with the story.the sounds are nicely done. this isn't a game of jamming rock music - it's a game of stealth. there are ambient noises that warn you of approaching guards, of a dog in the next room, of conversations of nearby people. the soft music, when it comes in, helps to add to the spookiness and tension.the ai really deserves special praise. the people around you don't just walk a beat that you watch 10 times in a row and then use. they react to situations with intelligence, keep an eye on things they should be guarding, and take proper caution when tracking down a problem. if they catch sight of you, they don't just go for you and give up. now that they know there's a strange person in the area, they actively hunt for you.sure, you can blackjack people if you have to. but the game isn't about violence. it's about avoiding being seen, avoiding being caught.highly recommended!   \n",

       "38528  looking for a challenging game that tests your mind and your reflexes  thief 3 rewards stealth and strategic thinking with glory and loot if you somehow missed the first 2 episodes in the thief saga  you are     a thief  you live in a medieval world full of murky inns  cobblestone streets and questionable denizens of the night  you get told of interesting items to steal by your fences  and do your best to acquire them in many ways  this compares favorably to splinter cell  albeit of a different era  your task is to stay hidden in the shadows  you have to pay careful attention to the level of darkness where you stand  and the type of surfaces you walk over  to not draw attention to yourself  you have interesting tools at your disposal   noisemaking arrows to distract  water arrows to put out candles the graphics aren t  quite  up to the level of splinter cell  but then again  not much is  you still get gorgeous shadows  dust motes twinkling in light streams  textures on floors and walls  the human figures are a bit clunky  but only a bit that being said  the cinemtics are exceptional  both graphic and sound wise  you really get drawn along with the story the sounds are nicely done  this isn t a game of jamming rock music   it s a game of stealth  there are ambient noises that warn you of approaching guards  of a dog in the next room  of conversations of nearby people  the soft music  when it comes in  helps to add to the spookiness and tension the ai really deserves special praise  the people around you don t just walk a beat that you watch 10 times in a row and then use  they react to situations with intelligence  keep an eye on things they should be guarding  and take proper caution when tracking down a problem  if they catch sight of you  they don t just go for you and give up  now that they know there s a strange person in the area  they actively hunt for you sure  you can blackjack people if you have to  but the game isn t about violence  it s about avoiding being seen  avoiding being caught highly recommended    \n",
